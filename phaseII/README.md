# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

While Phase I focused on the challenges that FriendMe faces in the social media landscape and the initial design considerations for the project, Phase II was dedicated to engaging real users in the design process, albeit ones that can be considered our peers. Importantly, these peers are other UX designers whose expertise involves similar projects, but whose perspective would lack the bias of our own. Though we had established a strong foundation in personas and scenarios, this real user feedback was crucial in stress testing any pain points we may have overlooked in a fictional context. 

## Methods

The key idea was to gather feedback from users to refine the design and interaction of FriendMe. For this purpose we opted to do a streamlined cognitive walthrough which required of our peer-addled inspection team to walk through the wireframes we created in this phase in an analytical manner. The catch here is that this had to be done from the perspective of one of our established personas. There were two questions they had to answer:

1. Will the user know what to do at this step?
2. If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress towards the goal?

For better context, each wireframe is designed in a way that outlined the user's journey through the app. From the landing page to the search tool, the wireframes are intended to communicate a visual summary that is roughly representative of our design considerations up until this point. At each step of this journey, our inspector team was asked to answer the two questions above that would help us identify any potential usability issues we had not considered.


## Findings

We obtained feedback from three UX designers who were able to provide us with valuable insights into the usability of our wireframes within the informed context of our personas. The feedback was generally positive, but there were a few key takeaways that we will need to address in the next phase of the project. As a quick recap of the personas we developed in Phase I, we have:

- John W. Richardson, a retiree who is eager to connect with others in his community and find events that interest him.
- Alice J. Cooper, a socially-anxious college student with a heavy course load who is looking for a way to connect with others in a low-pressure environment.

From the guise of Mr. Richardson, we understood that our main page did not communicate strong visibility of system information, namely it was not clear whether a user should click on an event photo or its title to view more information. Additionally, the search bar was not effective in communicating its purpose, especially when Mr. Richardson's goal was to find his friends. This lack of clarity proved inefficient for our user as he had to click on the wrong elements in the wireframe to find the information he was looking for.

Ms. Cooper, on the other hand, found that her social anxiety was not addressed in the wireframes, but was not able to elaborate. She did, however, mention that events were easy to find and were visually engaging.

## Conclusions

Despite the omission from Ms. Cooper regarding her social anxiety and its impact on usability, we believe it is an important oversight that we will need to address in the next phase of the project. We believe that as an application that is designed to connect users with events, it is crucial that we address the needs of all users, especially those who may have social anxiety. Though this process will require careful consideration, we will introduce usability features into the prototype design that will help users like Ms. Cooper navigate the app in the interest of easing their social anxiety.

The inclusion of Mr. Richardson in this walkthrough was vital to gather insight on a potentially older demographic that might be interested in using our app. Strong visual cues and navigational clarity will be key areas of focus moving forward.

## Caveats

We touched on this briefly under the Findings section, but it is worth mentioning that there might have been some confusion regarding the walkthrough. Only two of the three UX designers were able offer feedback in the format of a walkthrough or under the guise of a persona. Some of the feedback was offered in a more direct approach without the direction of the described method. Regardless, the feedback was still important and will be taken into consideration moving forward.

Another caveat is one we induced on our own. Our wireframes were limited to only one path through the app, namely the search tool. It describes a transitionary phase between the landing page and what a user might see when they type into the search bar. However, we did not provide wireframes for the calendar tool, which is a significant oversight. We attribute this due to our inexperience with Figma and an initial error that slowed our overall outcome during the design. This is something we will need to address in the next phase of the project as we dive into the prototype so that we can get a more comprehensive understanding of the user experience that is more representative of the entire application.
