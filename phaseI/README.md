# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

For Phase I of the project, we focused on understanding the challenges brought forth by social media as an industry, namely apps that rely on friend-making and scheduling as their minimum viable product. As a team, we decided that Meetup.com was closest in target to the expectations we had for our own app, FriendMe. Our objective was to identify key areas for improvement that can enhance user experience and engagement, particularly for individuals seeking community and connection online. This phase is dedicated to analyzing user needs, competitor landscape, and initial design considerations.

## Methods

Our approach to research included an initial competitive analysis between seven of our closest competitors. Key areas of evaluation invloved strengths, weaknesses, quality level, cost, and the platform each competitor was available on. This was an important step to better understand the temperature surrounding the industry we aim to enter, and how we as a latecomer can differentiate ourselves.

Once we narrowed focus to Meetup.com, we then conducted a heuristic evaluation. This evaluation aimed to test the usability of Meetup.com against established criteria standard in the industry, some of which include visibility of system status, error prevention, consistency and standards, match between system and the real world, user control and freedom, flexibility, efficiency of use, aesthetic design, recognition vs recall, documentation, and helping users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. Scoring was based on a 1-10 scale, with 1 being the worst and 10 being the best, in addition to a brief explanation of the score. This process informed the direction behind some of our early design considerations present in the sketches included with this report in hopes of avoiding the same pitfalls we identified in Meetup.com.

Finally, the development of personas and scenarios was crucial in understanding the potential need of our users through the lens of their daily lives. It gave them a face and contextual background to better understand a generalized user's needs and motivations, not only to use our app but in a way that proved meaningful to them as well.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
