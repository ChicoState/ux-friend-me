# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive analysis demonstrated that features across the seven analyzed competitors were strong, but **most were too different from our minimum viable product (MVP)** to be considered direct competitors. Some of the key findings were:
  * Meetup.com was the closest competitor to our MVP
  * Strengths included **powerful scheduling tools and event management**
  * Weaknesses included **a lack of social features**, such as social profiles and friend lists
* Heuristic evaluation of Meetup.com revealed opportunities for improvement:
  * A **text-heavy interface that could benefit from more visual cues**
  * Lack of personalization and customization
  * No visible documentation
* Personas and scenarios offered a more empathetic understanding of our users.
  * **Simplicity through visual cues** and **a focus on community-building** were key areas of focus for our users.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* **Cognitive walkthroughs** with peer UX designers answered important questions about the usability of our wireframes.
* Feedback was generally positive, but there were a few key takeaways that we will need to address in the next phase of the project.
  * Usability currently **lacks navigational clarity**
  * **Social anxiety** was not addressed in the wireframes
* Wireframes were an important tool in communicating our design considerations up to this point, but **they were limited to only one path** through the app.
